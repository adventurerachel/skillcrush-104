	<p>Don't be afraid to ask for help, even if it feels great to work things out on your own!</p>

			
			<h4>Fake it till you make it</h4>
			<p>Find out where to find the answers. There are a lot of good resources that the Skillcrush course links to.</p>

			<p>It's ok if you can't follow everything on the videos the first time round, because
			there is probably an exercise straight after that walks you through it.</p>
